# Auth-System-Dual-DB

A backend authentication system built with Node.js and Express, demonstrating how MongoDB and PostgreSQL (via Prisma) can be used together in a single application.

## 🚀 Features
- User authentication (signup and login)
- Secure password hashing
- Token-based authentication
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- PostgreSQL integration using Prisma
- Clean and modular backend code

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma
- JavaScript

## 🗄️ Database Overview
- **MongoDB** is used for authentication and user-related data because of its flexibility.
- **PostgreSQL** is used for structured and relational data with the help of Prisma ORM.

This project demonstrates how multiple databases can coexist and be managed within a single backend service.

## 📌 Notes
- This is a backend-only project.
- No frontend is implemented yet.
- Environment variables are stored in a `.env` file which is not included in the repository.

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice backend authentication concepts and understand real-world usage of both NoSQL and SQL databases in one application.
